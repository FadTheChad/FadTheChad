# Hello There
## I’m Fad.

### Some Stuff About Me
- I'm a random Pakistani 15 Y/O Student with a computer. 

- I’m interested in Discord Bot Development and discord.js using TypeScript.

- I’m currently learning NestJS and C#.

Below is my "very good" code.

```js
  if (fadsBrain.has('coding knowledge')) console.log('yay')

  TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'has')
```

As you can see by the above example, i write readable code and never get errors (real)
